Welcome to my project!

The goal for NetCheck is to provide the ability to assess your home's defense against modern and evolving digital threats, whether you're an IT expert or my 70 year old grandma.
We're starting simple with some short quizzes and remediation suggestions -- though there is much more in the works behind the scenes!
Feel free to share this site with any of your friends, family or loved ones and give them the assurance their digital assets are safe.

Thanks for stopping by!
